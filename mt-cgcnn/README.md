# Multi Task Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CGCNN)

This repository implements the Multi Task Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CGCNN) introduced in the paper titled "[MT-CGCNN: Integrating Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network with Multitask Learning for Material Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05660)". The model that takes as input a crystal structure and predicts multiple material properties in a multi-task setup.
